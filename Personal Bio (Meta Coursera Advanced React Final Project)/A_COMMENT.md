The person in this bio is obviously not me. The course gave me a mostly complete page based on someone else's projects and information, and the assignment was essentially to finsih it, using various libraries and advanced React concepts.

Early in the process of working on it, I got distracted multiple times thinking about all the things that I would do differently if it _was_ my own bio. How I would deliberately make the UI different from every other webpage that exists since I'm kind of sick of every webpage looking the same. How the page would have much more fluid animations and a look and feel that would feel a lot more like me. How I could combine it with another idea I got from somewhere else where I saw that someone had made their resume into a browser game...

I may have to actually make that bio webpage at some point. I've already created a note for it in my phone. Maybe I'll even buy a domain for it. ;)
